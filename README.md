# FinTech Case Study: Coinbase

## Overview and Origin

Coinbase

Incorporated in 2012

Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam

Coinbase  was created for anyone across the world to securely send and receive Bitcoin with ease. Founder Brain Armstrong states, “At Coinbase, our mission is to create an open financial system for the world. We believe that open protocols for money will create more innovation, economic freedom, and equality of opportunity in the world, just like the internet did for publishing information.”

The company has been funded by many venture capital firms and hedge funds.  Coinbase has currently raised $525 million from  Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management and Union Square Ventures.

## Business Activities

Coinbase is creating a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by cryptocurrency.  The company has created a retail exchange and also a wallet to allow even the most novice user to store, use, and trade digital currency.

The company’s intended consumers are both novice and professional traders.  Coinbase outlines its marketing strategy in phases, beginning with reaching new users through referral programs, SEO (search engine optimization), and adding easy to use payments in order  to attract novice users.  They intend to onboard institutional traders largely through sales and business development.  Today, Coinbase has approximately 43 million users, 7,000 institutions, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries.

Coinbase brings innovative solutions to the cryptosphere that simply cannot be matched by competitors by utilizing unfair advantages. The main unfair advantage that Coinbase utilizes is by giving the user the ability to use multiple sources of payment for cryptocurrency assets.  Currently, Coinbase offers users the option to purchase tokens via debit, credit, ACH bank transfer or with other cryptocurrencies.  In contrast, many other exchanges only allow users to purchase tokens with other cryptocurrencies. This poses a problem because it requires transferring coins between wallets and exchanges, which can be confusing for the novice user and also requires fees. 

Coinbase currently utilizes blockchain technology to secure and record data on ledgers containing transaction history.  They also use application software for the products to be used for both Apple and Android users.

## Landscape

Coinbase is a key player in the Crypto and Blockchain domain of the financial industry

Cryptocurrency is a relatively new form of payment that can be exchanged for goods and services online.  These assets work using blockchain technology, a decentralized technology spread among many computers that manage and record transactions.  Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008, one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, there has been a surge in new publicly traded crypto assets totaling upwards of 6,700 individual coins.  Since its inception, Bitcoin has reached price levels of $58,000, with a market cap that has topped at 1.2 Trillion.  Cryptocurrency has also caught the attention of many institutional investors.  The use of cryptocurrency has become much more common in the last 5-10 years, as companies are allowing consumers to use it as a form of payment. Companies like Microsoft, Overstock.com, AT&T, and BMW have all put systems in place to allow for payment in digital assets.  These trends suggest that digital currency, which was once thought to only have criminal use, is becoming more mainstream.

Other key companies in this domain include Ripple Labs, Inc., BitGo, Inc., CoinDesk.com, Bitfinex, BitPay, Inc., and eToro.

## Results

Coinbase has emerged as a leader in the cryptocurrency exchange industry.  They have developed multiple platforms including Coinbase, Coinbase Pro (platform for experienced users), and Custody (a platform designed for institutional investors).  Coinbase also hosts a wallet where assets can be held securely.  The company has become a crypto kingmaker for investors as listed assets have seen significant increases in value.  Coinbase has recently filed with the SEC to become a publicly traded company. 

The core metric that companies in this domain use to measure success consists mainly on the number of users on their platforms. Companies collect transaction fees for purchasing crypto assets.  Coinbase has added upwards of 43 million users and is collecting an average of 1% on each purchase through their platform. 

Coinbase outperforms their competition on many different metrics.  First being Coinbase’s ease of use, allowing even the most novice user to easily understand the platform.  The platform also allows the purchase of assets using a variety of different payments including credit, debit, ACH bank transfers and using other cryptocurrencies.  Coinbase is also highly liquid, allowing users to convert coins to cash easily and quickly.  They also offer a wide variety of assets to purchase and trade.

## Recommendations

Coinbase has room to improve on it’s interoperability between different blockchains.  Currently Coinbase’s wallet operates on the Ethereum blockchain and is not interoperable with other blockchains. 

By allowing Coinbase’s wallet to be interoperable between other blockchains would allow users to exchange and convert different assets without having to transfer between exchanges and wallets, costing time and accruing fees. For instance, if a user wanted to convert a currency supported by the Ethereum blockchain to a token on the Binance Chain, the user would have to take multiple steps to move assets from the Coinbase wallet to another exchange or wallet to complete the conversion. Introducing interoperability into Coinbase would allow users to trade assets not currently supported.

There are multiple solutions and technologies that can be utilized to solve the interoperability problem.  Blockchains could be brought together with a “mashup” application. They only have to interact with one consistent application programming interface (API) and not an API for every blockchain. This mashup application can include a variety of capabilities defined in data models and smart contracts that join various blockchains together.  Another solution would be to create a separate blockchain to facilitate cross communication from one blockchain to another.

These technologies would be an appropriate solution as it would allow for interoperability between multiple blockchains and push Coinbase further to their goal of creating an open financial system for the world.
